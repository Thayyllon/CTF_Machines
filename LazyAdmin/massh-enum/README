Description

OpenSSH versions 2.3 up to 7.4 suffer from a username enumeration vulnerability.

The attacker can try to authenticate a user with a malformed packet (for
example, a truncated packet), and:

- if the user is invalid (it does not exist), then userauth_pubkey()
  returns immediately, and the server sends an SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_FAILURE
  to the attacker;

- if the user is valid (it exists), then sshpkt_get_u8() fails, and the
  server calls fatal() and closes its connection to the attacker.
